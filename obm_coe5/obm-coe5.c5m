newmonster  "Frost Dragon Hatchling"
descr "Newly hatched dragons look just like their older brethren, just smaller, and during their first few months their scales are still soft as leather and their flesh is very tender. Many cultures consider the Dragon Hatchlings a delicacy, so both eggs and hatchlings are frequently hunted. In the western provinces, the hatchlings are gutted, pickled in honey vinegar and spices and then spit roasted and covered in sesame seeds. For a Fire Dragon hatchling the spices need to be light, as the meat in itself is dominated by heat. In the north the hatchlings are instead pickled for several weeks in whey and sour milk, and then cooked in the ground while stuffed with onions and leeks. Dwarves, being dwarves, do not understand the concept of a delicacy, so they just dry the hatchlings, grind them and then cook them into a porridge or slush together with ground-up roots and mushrooms."

descr "Newly hatched dragons look just like their older brethren, just smaller, and during their first few months their scales are still soft as leather and their flesh is very tender. Many cultures consider the Dragon Hatchlings a delicacy, so both eggs and hatchlings are frequently hunted. In the western provinces, the hatchlings are gutted, pickled in honey vinegar and spices and then spit roasted and covered in sesame seeds. For a Fire Dragon hatchling the spices need to be light, as the meat in itself is dominated by heat. In the north the hatchlings are instead pickled for several weeks in whey and sour milk, and then cooked in the ground while stuffed with onions and leeks. Dwarves, being dwarves, do not understand the concept of a delicacy, so they just dry the hatchlings, grind them and then cook them into a porridge or slush together with ground-up roots and mushrooms."

It is possible to tell a Mimic apart from an ordinary piece of furniture by touching it, as it is quite slimy. The slime is sticky and will make it difficult to move and escape from the Mimic, even though a chest shape is badly suited for movement."

descr "In fact, among the henchmen or retainers composing the bodyguards there are varying degrees of rank conferred by the chief whom they follow, and there is an eager rivalry between the retainers for the post of honor next their chief, as well as between the different chiefs for the honor of having the most numerous and the most valiant bodyguard.  Here lie dignity and strength.  From a surviving slave who managed to flee after serving as a captive for the Barbarian Leader, strange tales about some of these bodyguards have been recorded.  It is said that some of the most honored bodyguards at times of great omens are fetched by some of the oldest Enaries to a sacred place in the forest, where they must crawl through the skin of an old Wolf while the priest covers them with tattoos and markings.  Upon returning, their mind is different and they become grumpy and solitary.  It is said that they now are possessed by the spirit of the Bear, and can take that shape during battles.  Some reports have described small tame Wolves fighting on the Barbarian side in battles, but nothing indicates that they were once humans."

descr "In fact, among the henchmen or retainers composing the bodyguards there are varying degrees of rank conferred by the chief whom they follow, and there is an eager rivalry between the retainers for the post of honor next their chief, as well as between the different chiefs for the honor of having the most numerous and the most valiant bodyguard.  Here lie dignity and strength.  From a surviving slave who managed to flee after serving as a captive for the Barbarian Leader, strange tales about some of these bodyguards have been recorded.  It is said that some of the most honored bodyguards at times of great omens are fetched by some of the oldest Enaries to a sacred place in the forest, where they must crawl through the skin of an old Boar while the priest covers them with tattoos and markings.  Upon returning, their mind is different and they become grumpy and solitary.  It is said that they now are possessed by the spirit of the Bear, and can take that shape during battles.  Some reports have described small tame Boards fighting on the Barbarian side in battles, but nothing indicates that they were once humans."

descr "They all possess precisely the same physical characteristics, fierce eyes, unruly hair, and large frames which are good only for a spurt; they certainly have not a corresponding power of endurance for hard work, while, although inured by the nature of their climate and soil to hunger and cold, they have never learnt to withstand heat and thirst.  Generally speaking, the footmen are the most numerous, and the fighting line therefore is composed of both arms combined, all the fastest runners among the young men being chosen for the van, and by their great speed of foot being admirably suited for a cavalry engagement.  Not being a crafty or a cunning race, they furthermore disclose their secret thoughts in the freedom of the feast, and so the minds of all lie open and discovered.  In quenching their thirst they are by no means so temperate; let them but be given all the intoxicating liquor they choose to drink, and vice will make an easier conquest of them than the sword."
